Real-time compressive tracker, implemented in C.
====

When I started to port the codes, there wasn't a C++ version yet.
Well, several days later, the C++ version was released which made me
a little upset. The logic of the algorithm in the C++ version is very clear,
but It's not truely real-time tracker in my computer, ;(.

So, I continued to finish this C version, and it's:
--real-time for at least 3 targets tracking, in a normal people's PC.
--easy to extend and hack.

Note: I did not give a accurate check between this version and  the original version, If there's a bug, feel free to contact me or send a push request.
