Real-time compressive tracking, implemented in C.
====

When I started to port the codes, there wasn't a C++ version.
Well, several days later, the C++ version was released.
The logic of the algorithm in the C++ version is very clear,
but It's not truely real-time tracker in my computer, ;(.

So, I continued to finish this C version, and it's:
--real-time for one or two targets tracking, in a normal people's PC.
--easy to extend and hack.

Note: I did not give a accurate check to the original version, If there's bug
feel free to contact me or send a push requect.
